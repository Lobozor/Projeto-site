                    <h2>Primeiro anuncio</h2>
                        <p>Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. What was it, George, bird watching? (looks up from the TV) What Lorraine, what? Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance.(Clara gets up from her desk and opens the door. She smiles at Doc.) Oh, Emmett, won't you come in? No...I better not. I... What's wrong? I've come to say goodbye.</p><hr>

                    <h3>Segundo anuncio</h3>
                        <p>What was the meaning of that? It was right in front of him. Aye. (Tannen and his gang are still looking for Doc.) There he is, Buford.(v.o) King of the castle. Hello. (notices something) What the hell is this? (He presses a button.) (v.o) Lithium mode on. That's better, damn kids. (walks up to his son) Hey Ace. (Marty Jr. ignores him and continues watching TV.) Watching a little TV for a change? (Outside)(Street) They're taking her home, to your future home! We'll arrive shortly thereafter and get her out of there and go back to 1985. You mean I'm going to see where I live? I'm going to see myself as an old man? No, no, no Marty, that could resolve in a...(Doc realizes something and gives a "Huh!" groan) Great Scott! Jennifer could conceivably encounter her future self, the consequences of that could be disastrous. Doc, what do you mean?</p><hr>

                        <p>(Cut back to Marty.) (Marty gets the shoes out of the bag and puts the right one on. It automatically laces itself up.) Power laces, all right! (He puts on the left shoe and it does the same thing. He then gets the jacket out of the bag and puts it on, but it’s too big. Doc comes running back towards Marty.) This thing doesn't fit. (Doc presses a button. The jacket modifies so it fits Marty.) (v.o) Size adjusting, fits.(Doc and Marty are standing at the very edge of the tracks that end just at the Ravine. They walk back towards their horses.) Well, Doc, we can scratch that idea. I mean, we can't wait around a year and a half for this thing to get finished. Marty...it's perfect! You're just not thinking fourth dimensionally! Right, right. I have a real problem with that. Don't you see? The bridge will exist in 1985. It's safe and still in use. Therefore, as long as we get the Delorean up to 88 miles per hour before we hit the edge of the ravine, we'll instantaneously arrive at a point in time where the bridge is completed. We'll have track under us, and coast safely across the ravine!</p>
